These assessments can measure skills, potential, and role fit. We recommend choosing scientifically-backed, reliable, and valid assessments to ensure objectivity, accuracy, and legal defensibility in hiring.\nThe selection of assessment tools should be driven by the specific requirements and competencies of each role. For example, some skills assessments are ideal for roles where job-specific knowledge and skills are critical, while cognitive ability tests are more suited for roles requiring problem-solving and analytical thinking. Structured interviews can offer insights into a candidate's experience and cultural fit.\nThe key to success is using a combination of these tools that aligns with outcomes critical to the role. SHL's Early Careers Solution is a pre-built package that streamline this process, ensuring that assessments are optimized to meet your hiring needs and deliver valuable insights at every stage of the talent selection process.\nSHL's skills assessments measure all 96 skills in our taxonomy, reporting back on a priority of skills that are most predictive of success in early careers roles. This set of skills has been identified through validation studies with thousands of organizations and insights from 45 years of experience and 45 billion data points.\nIt depends on candidate volume, dropout concerns, and how much you want to automate interviews. We recommend getting in touch to access our graduate blueprints, which offer research-backed guidance on the best assessment timing for your needs.\nWhy SHL?\n10,000+\nOver 10,000 organizations worldwide partner with SHL for smarter talent decisions.\n45B\nSHL uses 45 billion data points to support benchmarking and predictive decision-making.\n3X\nManagers are 3x more likely to rate SHL-assessed new hires as \"excellent\" after 6 months.\nYour New Graduate Hiring Partner\nSHL delivers a simple-to-deploy solution to help you identify high potential graduates, interns, and apprentices.

It includes hiring the right people, talent development through targeted programs, planning leadership succession, and creating clear career pathways. Using connected, objective data across these programs helps you make faster, fairer decisions and prepare talent for what's next.\nStrategic workforce planning aligns business strategy with the people and skills required. It means understanding current capability, forecasting demand, and moving talent into critical roles to keep the organization ready. Strategic workforce planning helps prevent talent shortages and reduces reliance on external hiring.\nIntegrated talent management solutions let you assess employees once and reuse that data across hiring, talent development, succession planning, and internal mobility. This eliminates redundant assessments for participants, gives HR a consistent view of talent across programs, and reveals hidden high-potential employees who might otherwise be overlooked. The result is faster decisions, better participant experience, and stronger leadership pipelines.\nBy connecting objective data from talent development programs, high-potential identification, and succession planning, organizations can identify future leaders earlier and track their readiness more accurately. This strengthens your leadership pipeline, reduces reliance on external hires for senior roles, and ensures smoother leadership transitions when critical roles open.\nThey're stronger together. Objective results from manager development and talent development programs can also flag early high-potential talent—so you don't run separate assessments for each program and you build a more diverse leadership pipeline.\nHigh-potential results can inform leadership development, readiness decisions, and internal mobility—reused alongside other talent data to build a reliable leadership pipeline without starting from scratch. This integrated approach to talent development creates continuity across your talent management strategy.\nMaximize Your People’s Potential\nIncrease the accuracy, objectivity, and impact of all your people decisions with real-time talent insights and analytics."

We have no idea what’s being asked. We have no idea what’s being said. There’s no real documentation.”\nHead of Talent Acquisition at a Large US Bank\nGreat Interviewing Begins with Science\nWith Smart Interview Professional, you get a complete solution that combines structure, science, and analytics to turn interviews into a reliable, data-driven hiring tool.\nVisibility Like Never Before\nFor the first time, gain real-time visibility into how interviews are conducted across your organization. Smart Interview Professional’s analytics track adherence to best practices—from speaking time balance to scoring accuracy—so you can measure, refine, and continuously improve interviewer performance across your teams.\n“Who is spending more time talking—the recruiter or the candidate? Who is showing up on time? With Smart Interview Professional, senior managers can coach their TA teams with the proper tools and analytics, and see how they are performing against KPIs. We’ve never had that before.”\nSenior Director of Talent Acquisition Strategy, Financial Services organization\nSmart Interview Professional: Demo Hub\nDiscover how SHL Smart Interview Professional works in action – from scheduling and preparation to interview execution, decision-making and interviewer analytics.\nGet Started with Smarter Interviewing\nTake a look at our blog series to see how interviewing is evolving, common interviewing myths, and why interview intelligence can transform hiring success.\nSmart Interview Professional\nFrequently Asked Questions\nThe solution works best when making candidate selections towards the end of the hiring process. It helps you run structured interviews to select the right candidates to progress through to the offer stage, and delivers interviewer analytics to continually improve interviewing outcomes.\nIf you have a high volume of candidates, and need to create a shortlist to progress further to second-stage interviews, our Smart Interview on Demand solution is ideal. Candidates record responses to your interview questions at their own convenience, and our solution automates scoring to enable you to review thousands of candidates in minutes.\nWe recommend structured interviews. A structured interview is a consistent and standardized process where all candidates are asked the same predetermined questions in the same order. Each candidate’s responses are also scored with the same pre-determined rating scale. In other words, they have structure built into the way the interview is conduced and the way the candidate is cored.\nBy comparison, unstructured interviews are more conversational, where the goal is to get to know the person and ask questions about the role as you go. The questions asked may be tailored to the specific candidate based on their background or experience, and because this style of interview is so relaxed, no two interviews for the same job are the same.\nStructured interviews are consistent, repeatable and scalable. So when they are executed correctly you will reduce bias and improve comparability between candidates. They are scientifically proven to be one of the most predictive tools for assessing job performance – five times more effective at predicting job performance than unstructured interviews. They are also considerably more efficient. Research shows it takes between three and four unstructured interviews to match the accuracy of data from a single structured interview.\nAn interview guide is a roadmap for you or your team, which contains all the structure and elements of your interview process. The guide keeps on your track during every interview and is essential to running a structured interview. Without the interview guide it’s easy to lose focus, skip important questions, or spend too much time on less relevant details. It also keeps the scoring criteria front of mind.\nWith Smart Interview Professional, it’s easy to create the interview guide. We recommend competencies and skills to assess in the interview using just a few pieces of information, such as the job title. Once you’ve selected the important things to evaluate in the interview, you’re able to select questions to measure these competencies and skills from our library of questions. We have mapped science-backed interview questions to more than 800 job roles and also have an option to use AI to read a job description and align the appropriate interview questions with that. In addition, you can add questions specific to your company values.\nWithin the interview guide, Smart Interview Professional also has a scoring framework and guide for each question, plus the ability to record notes and scores alongside each question.\nStructured interviews is among the strongest predictors of future job success, but other objective methods of assessment – like personality, skills and cognitive ability assessments – are still essential to give you additional relevant data to use to find the best candidates in your applicant pool.\nSet a New Standard for Interviewing\nWith decades of psychometric expertise and cutting-edge technology, SHL makes interviewing a reliable, effective tool for confident, data-driven talent decisions.\nBook a Demo"

However, it does not indicate whether the individual will successfully integrate into the team and how likely they are to stay at the organization. And the evidence suggests that the idea that candidates with more experience will perform better and go on to be long-tenured employees is unfounded. The more important takeaway should be – has the candidate learned from their previous experiences? It’s vital that hiring managers evaluate how candidates have dealt with situations in the past.\nOften one of the reasons that employers look for candidates with experience is that they think previous jobs have helped those people build up knowledge and skills. But we’d recommend focusing on the knowledge, skills and personality traits directly rather than using experience as a proxy for these.\nWe believe that candidates are so much more than their resume. A data-driven approach using objective measurement gives a full picture of the individual and enables you to understand their capability based on their readiness to do the job today, their fit with your organization as well as their future potential for growth and impact.\nWe define readiness as the capability of a candidate relative to day one of a specific job role. It comprises the hard and soft skills, and the knowledge that will allow the individual to be successful against the needs of the job right away.\nA candidate’s potential refers to their capacity to develop into something further — and it’s an important consideration if succession planning and promotability are important.\nFit refers to culture fit, company fit and team fit and its importance increases if you need to tackle turnover, drive higher engagement, or add rigor to the cultural experience of your employees.\nBy measuring all of these three elements in an experienced hire, you’re more likely to select the individuals that will thrive in their role and stay longer at your organization.\nAnd that’s in addition to objective measurement also helping you to remove bias from the selection process and making it easier to compare candidates against each other, removing the guesswork from hiring decisions.\nOne of the biggest challenges for HR leaders is the level of change in organizations. Roles are evolving at an unprecedented rate which means that the shelf life of some skills is shrinking as new skill requirements come to the fore. This means that the ability to assess and understand an individual’s reskilling potential has never been more crucial, as the traditional skills that once guaranteed success are no longer sufficient. Even experienced hires need to have the ability to learn and adapt to new technologies in the future.\nThat’s why we’ve built a measure into our professional hiring solution that will give you a comprehensive view of both the individual’s critical skills needed for today and their ability and willingness to pick up new skills for the future. This foresight can be the difference between a workforce that thrives and one that becomes obsolete.\nWith experience under their belts, candidates are likely to have a clear picture of what they want from their career and their next employer. While they will have already been more selective with their applications, you can stand out on their shortlist by building a stronger connection with the candidate throughout the hiring experience.\nWith our hiring platform, there are two quick ways to build engagement early in the recruitment phases. Firstly, showcase your company’s mission and values through videos of existing experienced hires which can be presented to the candidates at any stage in the hiring process. And secondly, provide auto-generated personalized feedback to every candidate, immediately – helping them to feel that the process has been a valuable experience for them, whatever the outcome.\nWith hiring around the world in decline, we know that there’s an even higher focus on making sure that every hire is the right one; talent acquisition professionals say that recruiting high quality candidates is the number one topic that will shape recruiting over the next five years. And yet one in three companies are not confident in their interview process and one in two companies have lost high quality talent due to a poor interview process.\nIf you’re looking to conduct focused, structured interviews when hiring professionals, our Smart Interview Professional Solution will help. Whether you’re conducting interviews face to face or virtually, this solution combines structure, science and analytics to transform interviews into a reliable and data-driven hiring tool. From building structured interview guides to optimizing interviewer performance, every step is designed to improve fairness, consistency and hiring outcomes.\nIf you have an objective and reliable hiring process in place, you will have collected a large amount of data – probably more than you need for recruitment purposes alone. We recommend making the most of this talent insight by reusing it to build development plans for your new recruits, keeping these more expensive experienced hires engaged in the organization for longer.\nWith our Professional Hiring Solution, you will generate development and motivation insights from the pre-hire assessments. You can initially use this data to build a tailored on-boarding program; use the candidate’s strengths, areas for development, and motivations to assign their first projects and to enable success from day one. And longer-term, hiring managers can support career-pathing conversations and employees can take ownership of their growth and development within the organization."

It provides insights into an individual's potential by matching their preferences to role requirements and is backed by science with strong predictive accuracy.\nSHL's adherence to legal and scientific standards ensures that its assessments are developed and validated to be fair, reliable, and appropriate for their intended purposes in selection processes. The reliability of SHL assessments is reviewed during test development as well as a part of ongoing test maintenance practices. We document the reliability of our assessments (e.g., through test-retest and internal consistency methods) in our technical manuals.\nPsychometric assessments are standardized tests designed to assess candidates' cognitive abilities, personality traits, job-related skills and behavioral styles. They help organizations understand how candidates may perform in specific roles. SHL assessments are scientifically developed tools built on psychometric principles, ensuring they are reliable, valid, and suitable for making informed talent decisions.\nPsychometric assessments offer objective and reliable insights into candidates' individual differences such as skills, abilities, personality traits, and potential, enabling organizations to make informed talent decisions. They help ensure a strong fit for specific roles and promote fairness by reducing bias. When applied consistently throughout the talent lifecycle, these assessments provide valuable data for strategic talent decisions, enhancing organizational agility and maximizing workforce effectiveness.\nYes, many providers, including SHL, can offer fully customizable assessments that align with your organization's specific competencies, values, and culture so that you get exactly what you need out of your talent processes.\nWhile AI-inferred talent data may offer some value, it is often less reliable and may introduce inaccuracies. Psychometric assessments, on the other hand, provide a more objective and scientifically validated understanding of what a candidate can do. In practice, AI-inferred data might be combined with psychometric data, but for robust and defensible decision-making, psychometric tools offer greater reliability and value.\nSHL's adherence to legal and scientific standards ensures that its assessments are developed and validated to be fair, reliable, and appropriate for their intended purposes in selection processes. Information and evidence regarding the content, construct, and criterion-related validity of our assessments is documented in our technical manuals. However, the validity of these assessments depends on their proper use, which is beyond our control. We advise users to adhere to best practices to ensure accurate and fair outcomes.\nSHL's adherence to legal and scientific standards ensures that its assessments are developed and validated to be fair, reliable, and appropriate for their intended purposes in selection processes.
